❄️ FrostRTP
A lightweight, safe, and highly configurable Random Teleport (RTP) plugin for Spigot/Paper Minecraft servers.

✨ Features:

✅ Safe teleportation (avoids lava, water, fire, cacti, etc.)

🌍 Multi-world support — define different RTP types for different worlds

⏱️ Per-type cooldowns with bypass permission (rtp.bypass)

🔐 Permission-based RTP types (e.g., /rtp nether, /rtp end)

🧭 Configurable min/max radius

👥 "Near" mode — teleport only if enough players are online in the target world

🎨 Full hex color support (&#RRGGBB) in messages

🔄 In-game reload with /nrtp reload (permission: rtp.admin.reload)

📦 Async location search — no TPS lag!

⚠️ Uses /nrtp as the default command (to avoid conflicts). Change it in plugin.yml if needed.
